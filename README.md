# C-For-Beginners

This repository contains daily C programming practice programs, starting from the basics and gradually moving towards core concepts and data structures.

The goal of this repository is to build strong fundamentals in C, improve problem-solving skills, and support academic learning alongside practical coding practice.

## Goals
- Understand C programming from scratch
- Strengthen logic and low-level programming concepts
- Practice consistently with small, clear programs
- Build a strong foundation for data structures and algorithms

## Repository Structure
- basics/ → variables, loops, conditionals, functions
- arrays/ → array operations and examples
- pointers/ → pointer basics and usage
- data_structures/ → linked lists, stacks, queues
- mini_exercises/ → small practice problems

## Learning Approach
- Simple and beginner-friendly code
- One or more programs added daily
- Focus on clarity and understanding over complexity
